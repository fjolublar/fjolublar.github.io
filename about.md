title: About this website
---

This Website serves as a cheat sheet for a multitude of software and other programming tools. Everything is hosted in github using Jekyll.

For details, it is better to check out their respective documentations.

I will provide all the links to the original creators and where I got the info, as best as I can.

I created this website to be used for quick views of some important commands of different tools I use daily.
