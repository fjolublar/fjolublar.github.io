### Types

```python
type( 5 )                             Int
type( 5.0 )                           Float
type( "A" )                           String
type( name = True )                   BOOL
type( a = [1,2,3,4] )                 List
type( a = (1,2,3,4) )                 Tuple
type( a = {1,2,3,4} )                 Set
type( a = {1 : "2", 2 : "3"} )        Dict
```

### Strings 

```python
name = "Example"
name[0]                   #>> E       #The First Character
name[-1]                  #>> e       #The Last Character
name * 2;                 #>> ExampleExample 
name + name;              #>> ExampleExample 

name = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
name[:]                               #Select the whole string
name[0:4]                 #>> ABCD    #Select 4 Characters from the string
                                      #Start from 0 till 4 without counting 4
name[4:]                              #Select all Characters after the 4-th indexed
name[x:y:z]                           #Start from X Go to Y with Steps of Z. xyz = ints
name[::-1]                            #Flip the string backwards

#---------String Methods--------------#

len (name)                #>> 5       #Gives the length of the string
name.upper() = INDRIT     #>> EXAMPLE #Return Upper Case of the Characters
name.lower() = indrit     #>> example #Return Lower Case of the Characters
name.title() = Indrit     #>> Example #Return str with the first Character UpperCase

name = "First Second Third Forth"
name.split(" ")           #>> ["First", "Second", "Third", "Forth"]
                                      #Split returns a list of all the words separated with space in the string

name.count("e")           #>> 1       #Count return the number of times a character is string
                                      #Count is Case Sensitive
name.find("Fifth")        #>> 0       #Returns where <string> is in the string. 
                                      #Returns only the position of the first character

name.replace("Second","Fifth")        #Replace replaces the string with another string

print("Hello", end="\n")              #Print the strings with a new line at the end
print("Hello", end=" ")               #Changing the end argument to put what we want to the end not new line

print("Hello","World","!", sep = "")  #Change the spacing of elements of the print

name = "Example"
print("My name is " + Example)        #>> My name is Example


first_name = raw_input( "What is your first name?:" )

                                      #raw_input is a method that accepts only string
                                      #If we want to insert int, We need to convert it to int 
									  
age        = int( raw_input( "Insert Number:" ) )  
first_name = raw_input ("What is your First name? \n")
surname    = raw_input ("What is your Last name? \n ")

print ("Your full name is " + first_name + " "  + surname )

                                      #Using   .format()  method
                                      #Curly brackets are used to substitute the strings that we put
									  
print ("Your full name is {} {}"           .format( first_name , surname) )
print ("Your First name has {} characters" .format( len( first_name ))         )
print ("Your Last name has {} characters"  .format( len( surname    ))         )

                                      #We can use f-strings as well
print ( f"Your full name is {first_name} {surname}")							      
```

### Dictionaries

Dictionaries are used to store key:value pairs in python.
* Each key-value pair is called an item
* Each key-value pair is separated with a comma
* Each key is separated from its value with a colon ":"
* They don't contain duplicate keys, Keys are unique
* Key can NOT be a list
* Key can be a number or a string or a tuple
* Values can be on themself a Dictionary.

```python
this_empty_dict = {}
this__dict      = { "key_1" : "value_1",
                    "key_2" : "value_2"}

#------------Dictionary methods---------------#

len (this_dict)                                # How many elements are in the dictionary
this_dict  = dict( zip( <list_a>, <list_b> ) ) # Create a dictionary from a list of tuples 
this_dict  = dict.fromkeys( <list_of_keys> )   # Create a dictionary from the specified keys and values. Default values = None
other_dict = this_dict.copy()                  # Create a copy of the dictionary

this_dict.clear()                              # Remove all elements from the dictionary. Leave it empty
this_dict.items()                              # Return a list of tuples of all the keys-values
this_dict.keys()                               # Return a list of all the keys
this_dict.values()                             # Return a list of all the values
list( dic.keys() )                             # Create a list of the keys of the Dictionary

this_dict.get( <key> )                         # Return the value of a key
this_dict.get( <key>, <default_value> )        # Return the value of a key if it exists. If not, return the default value
this_dict.pop( <key> )                         # Remove the element with the specified key. Returns the value
this_dict.popitem()                            # Remove the last inserted key-value pair. Returns the key-value tuple
del this_dict [ <key> ]                        # Delete the element defined by key. Don'r return anything
this_dict.setdefault( <key>, <default_value> ) # Return the value of a key if it exists. If not, set it with the default value

this_dict.update( <another_dict> )             # Update the dictionary with elements of another dictionary
{ **this_dict, **another_dict }                # Same as above. Join 2 dictionaries 

value_of_key       = this_dict [ <key> ]       # Get the value associated with the given key
this_dict[ <key> ] = <new_value>               # Assign a new value to the key
```

### Build-in Python functions

Assert / Raise 

```python
x = "example"

#if condition returns False, AssertionError is raised:
assert x == "EXAMPLE", "x should be 'EXAMPLE'"

#this can be seen as:
if x != "example":
  raise AssertionError("x should be 'example'")

```
Assert can be used in debugging. It will "stop" the script and throw an AssertionError. 
DO NOT use in production. Some tools used in production (optimization) will just not use them.
Better use a `Try: Catch:` block with the `raise` keyword to handle Errors and Exeptions as you want them.

```python
class Custom_error(BaseException):
    pass
	
try:
    print("hello")
    raise Custom_error
    print("world")
except Custom_error:
    print("found it not stopping now")
```
The `raise` keyword is used to raise an Exeption or Error. Can be our own created one or a Python one.
Can be integrated in `Try: Catch:` block in order to not stop the program but continue it running.

### zip

The zip() function returns a zip object. 

```python
items = ("Item_1", "Item_2", "Item_3")
tools = ("Tool_1", "Tool_2", "Tool_3", Tool_4)

x = zip(items, tools)

print( tuples ( x ) )  

#We use the tuple() function to display a readable version of the object.
  
```

### Misc

### Virtual ENV

Working with virtual environment in Python. This is used to isolate environments.

Install the library:
```python
~$ pip install virtualenv
```
Create the new environment:
```python
~$ virtualenv <cool_new_environment>
```
Activate the new environment:
```python
~$ source <cool_new_environment>/bin/activate
```
Disable the new environment:
```python
~$ deactivate
```
Check more in the [Documenation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html)


### Pip

Working with `pip`.

Save all the libraries that are installed, into a requirements.txt file
```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt 
```
Install all the libraries from requirements.txt file.
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

### Pickle

`pickle` is a library used to serialize and deserialize python objects.
Converting them to a byte stream to be send over the network or to be saved in a file format.
Read more in the [Doc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html)

How to Save data using Pickle:

```python
import pickle

with open('save.p', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(dictionary_to_save, file)

with open('save.p', 'rb') as file:
    dictionary_to_load = pickle.load(file)
```

Ref: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11218477/how-can-i-use-pickle-to-save-a-dict)

Pickle does not play nicely with user-created classes and objects. 
When trying to load user-created objects rewrite the class definition in the script again.
