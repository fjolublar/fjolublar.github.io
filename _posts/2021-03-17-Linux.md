### 2. Resource Management Commands

| **Command**  | **What does it do?** |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| `free`          |  Tells us the amount of Memory used by the system             |
| `free -m`       | The same but in MB                                            |
| `df`            |  Means disc free. Tells us how much diskspace is being used   |
| `df -h`         |  Makes it better and easier to read.   "h" is human-readible. |
{: .tablelines}


"free" memory is the memory that is not used at all by the system.
"available" memory is the memory that exist but reserved for caches/system logs and stuff.

It's weird but Linux has a finite number of files. So we can have free disk space but if the nr.files is full
we can't add more. These are called i-nodes.

### 7. MISC

`spd-say`

Use this tool, for the system to say something or to inform you that a task finished:
```sh
~$ sudo apt-get update; spd-say "Task Finished"
```

install gnome-tweak tool
[sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool] you can actually choose between coherent or independent behavior
of your multiple monitors across workspaces.
Once installed, launch tweak and then click on workspaces. then choose
 " Workspaces span displays" (instead of the default choice "Workspaces on primary display only" !)
 
`\time`       #time option doesn't work
\#time is not a builtin; I mean it's not treated as a command; it's a keyword. 
\#That's why tricks like \time 
		
Streams in Linux: Input, Output and Error Streams

stdin  (standart input)  Input:
stdout (standart output) Output:  Every thing that returns info from the terminal is a standart Output Stream
stderr (standart error)  Error :  >> ls ini3      #cannot access.     #This is Error stream


### Bash Alias

To create Bash aliases we do the following

```sh
~$ alias <alias_name>="<command>"

#Examples

~$ alias ll="ls -lh"                              #Better List 
~$ alias lt="ls -h --size -1 -S --classify"       #List files by size
~$ alias myip="curl ipinfo.io/ip"                 #Get Public IP
```

To make this alias permanent we need to modify the `./bashrc` file. 
```sh
~$ nano ~/.bashrc
```
After adding the alias in the file and saving the changes we close the file and run:
```sh
~$ source ~/.bashrc
```

### Extra Tools and Programs

### Screen

If you run a long running process or task on a machine that you are connected with SSH, and the connection drops,
we lose the console we were connected to and the work with it. To be able to leave the task running, even if we lose
connection, we can use the tool `screen`. Screen uses "virtual separate terminals". Even if we lose connection we can still
attach to the session terminal.

To install screen we run:
```sh
~$ sudo apt-get install screen
```

To use screen, the most useful commands are:

```sh
~$ screen -S <name_screen_session>   # Create a new screen terminal with a given name
~$ screen -ls                        # List all the screen terminals currently running
< CTRL + a + d on_keyboard >         # Detach from screen terminal. Leave it running on background
~$ screen -r <id_screen>             # Reattach to the screen terminal specified
~$ screen -d <id_screen>             # Detach to the screen terminal specified
```

### watch

`watch` is a very useful command in Linux to check the result of a command for regular interval times.
We use it when we want to check the command output and how it changes with time. In order to not write the command ourselfs
many time, we use this tool.

```sh
~$ watch -n 1 <linux_command>
```
The `-n` tag is used to set the time interval that the command will be run. Default is 2 seconds.
In order to use `watch` with commands that have a pipe \| we need to put all the command in brackets

```sh
~$ watch -n 1 "<linux_command> | <linux_command>"
```


### wondershaper
 
 `wondershaper` is a tool that is used to limit the bandwidth on a specific network card.
Install [wondershaper](https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper) from Github. Do not install it with `sudo apt-get` because it will install an older not maintained version.
 
| **Command**  | **What does it do?** |

### iperf3
 
`iperf3` is a tool used to measure the maximum bandwidth of a link. 
See [Iperf Documentation](https://iperf.fr/iperf-doc.php) for more information.
This tool is a CPU intensive one and the results we get are always lower than theoretical maximum speed of a network link.
 
| **Command**  | **What does it do?** |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| `iperf3 -s`                   |  Iperf Server                                     |  
| `iperf3 -s -D`                |  Iperf Server in background as a Daemon           | 
| `iperf3 -c 192.168.1.8`       |  Iperf client                                     |  
| `iperf3 -c 192.168.1.8 -t 10` |  Time in seconds to transmit                      |  
| `iperf3 -c -u 192.168.1.8`    |  Use UDP instead of TCP. (Check Documentation)    |  
| `iperf3 -c 192.168.1.8 -R`    |  -R. Client in reverse test mode – Server sends, client receives     |
