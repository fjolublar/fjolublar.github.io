In this page you'll find `Regex` commands, findings, small scripts etc.
Regex is used to match a pattern in a string.

<style>
.tablelines table, .tablelines td, .tablelines th {
        border: 1px solid black;
        }
</style>

### Character Class

```
\d        #Digit character (number)
\w        #Word character (letters & numbers)
\s        #Space character (space, tab, \n)

\D        #Non-Digit character
\W        #Non-Word character 
\S        #Non-Space character 

# Creating our own Character-Classes. Putting characters inside [ ] 

[aeiouAEIOU]     #Match Vowels 
[^aeiouAEIOU]    #Match everything that is not a Vowel
[0-9a-zA-Z]      #Match ranges of stuff. Same as \w  
[\(\)]           #Match ( or )
```

### Punctuation = Escape

```
.
*
(
)
^
$
|
?
\
[
]
{
}
+
```
If we want to match these puctuation characters we have to put a escape character in from of them.
`\`

### Specifying Quantity

```
\d                   #One Digit
\d?                  #Zero or One Digit
\d*                  #Zero or More Digits 
\d+                  #One or More Digit
\d{3}                #Exactly 3 Digits
\d{3,5}              #Between 3 and 5 Digits
\d{3,}               #3 or More Digits
[aeiouAEIOU]{3,}     #3 or more Vowels 
```

### Grouping

```
([^aeiou][AEIOU])+   #Match this combination, One or More 
(,\d{3})             #Match ,digit Exactly 3.
```
Be careful: Special characters lose their special meaning inside sets.
For example, \[(+*)\] will match any of the literal characters '(', '+', '*', or ')'

### OR AND

```
() | ()              #Match this group or that group
```

### Everything

```
.                    #Match any character except newline
.*                   #Match whatever. Match Any character Zero or More
.*?                  #Match the least of whatever. Non Greedy-Version

<.*?>                #Match everything that is in between < >
<.*>                 #Match everything that is in between < >. Greedy. Doesn't stop on the first >
```

### Re Library

```python
import re
myRegex = re.compile('regex pattern')
mo      = myRegex.search('haystack string')
print(mo.group())
```

Example

```python
import re
myRegex = re.compile(r'/d{3}-/d{3}-/d{4}')
mo      = myRegex.search('Hello. My number is 123-456-7899. Call me!')
if mo is not None:
	print(mo.group())
```
Keep in mind we used `r""` string. This is `raw` string. If we used `normal` strings we would have to
use `\` nefore every pattern. So for Digits it would be `\\d`.
