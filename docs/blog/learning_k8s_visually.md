## Challenges with the Traditional Kubernetes Model


**Next Steps:** Interested in seeing this new model in action? We invite you to explore kcp through a self-guided workshop. It's a hands-on way to experience these concepts using just a Linux environment (even Google Cloud Shell works). Check out the guide and give it a try: **[kcp Multi-Tenancy Workshop](https://github.com/kcp-dev/contrib/tree/main/kubecon.eu.workshop/20250401-kubecon-london/workshop) from KubeCon Europe 2025**. See for yourself how Kubernetes, combined with kcp, can become the backbone of your next-generation platform – and imagine what that could mean for your organization.
