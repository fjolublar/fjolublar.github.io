# Hi there 👋, 

![The Pragmatic Programmer](/img/logo_fjolublar.png) <br>
I'm Indrit, <br>
Currently I am working for the [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) project in SAP.
Gardener is an open-source tool used to manage thousands of Kubernetes clusters across SAP and elsewhere.

Other than that I quite enjoy working with Python in various aspects such as Cloud, Data Processing, Machine Learning, Visualization, etc. <br>
My passion lies in learning, understanding, and reducing complexity to something that is easily taught. 
I love being part of this amazing world of cloud development. <br>
Thanks for having me :).
