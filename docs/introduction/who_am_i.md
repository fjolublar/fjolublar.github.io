# Hi there 👋, 

My name is Indrit <br>
I am currently working for the [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) project in SAP.
Gardener is an open-source tool used to manage thousands of Kubernetes clusters across SAP and elsewhere.

Other than that I quite enjoy working with Python in various aspects such as Cloud, Data Processing, Machine Learning, Visualization, etc. <br>
My passion lies in learning, understanding, and reducing complexity to something that is easily taught. <br>
I love being part of this amazing world of cloud development.
Thanks for having me :).
